# Creating a Word Ladder with Djikstra's Algorithm

Recieving input of a dictionary of 5 letter words, a starting word and a destination word, translate the dictionary into a graph of words, 
then use Djikstra's shortest path algorithm to find a word ladder between the starting word and the destination word, 
where each step on the ladder is the change of one letter, and the distance is weighted by the distance between two letters, i.e. A to C has a weighted distance of two.
